This module exports a `groq` helper function to assist with GROQ syntax highlighting and [eslint rules](https://github.com/asbjornh/eslint-plugin-groq). Make sure to install [the VSCode extension](https://github.com/sanity-io/vscode-sanity) - and enjoy!

It is globally available throughout your project via auto-imports.

## Example

```vue
<script>
// In VS Code this will be highlighted
const query = groq`*[_type == "article"][0].title`
</script>
```
